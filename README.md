## pySolarCalc
Solar design and NEC calculations implemented with a python backend and excel front end.

My experience working in the solar industry is that every firm has their own excel spreadsheet (often a bit unwieldy) to perform solar design calculations and NEC compliant cable and conduit calculations.

This approach works, but there are enough calculations and table lookups that the calculation stream often becomes confusing.  Additionally, version control is not always easy with Excel.

The goal of this project is to create a efficient and user-friendly solar design tool that is open source.  

## Future Development
* Database of inverters and modules
* Climatic design condition lookup
* String sizing tool
* DC/AC loading calculation
* DC & AC NEC compliant conduit and cable sizing
